IMCoalHMM
=========

Cleaner re-implementation of CoalHMMs specialised for pairs of genomes in an isolation-migration model.

Without having to deal with the general cases with an arbitrary number of samples the algorithms can be made much simpler, so this library should be both cleaner and faster than the general library, but at the cost of only modelling isolation-with-migration models.
